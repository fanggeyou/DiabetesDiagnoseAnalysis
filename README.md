# DiabetesDiagnoseAnalysis

In this project, I analyzed data on diabetes diagnose collected from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

By taking a deeper look into the factors, such as number of discharges and payments, we can have a detailed understanding of diabetes diagnose in the United States through visualizing the data on R. 

The original dataset is too big to be uploaded onto GitHub, so please use the following URL to find the dataset used in this project: https://www.kaggle.com/speedoheck/inpatient-hospital-charges

A full report of the process and key findings of this project in PDF format can also be found in this repository.
